# End-to-End Simple ML Project

This is a beginner-friendly end-to-end machine learning project using an Algerian forest fire dataset.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `data/` - Contains the dataset.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for exploration and model training.
- `src/` - Source code for data processing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `README.md` - Project overview and instructions.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset includes environmental features like temperature, humidity, wind, and fire indices. The target is a binary class indicating whether a fire occurred.

## ⚙️ ML Workflow

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature selection
4. Model training and evaluation
5. Model deployment (optional)
